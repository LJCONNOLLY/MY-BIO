## My Digital Portfolio

Hello! I‚Äôm **[Your Name]**, a writer, researcher, and educator exploring the intersections of **technology, literacy, and culture**. This site showcases my ongoing projects, teaching materials, and scholarly work in digital writing and media studies.

My work focuses on how digital environments shape communication practices, from social media narratives to multimodal composition. I‚Äôm especially interested in questions like:

* How do digital platforms transform what it means to ‚Äúwrite‚Äù?
* What new literacies emerge in online, interactive, or algorithmic spaces?
* How can we teach writing that prepares students for a post-print world?

### About This Site

This portfolio serves as both a **professional showcase** and an **experimental space** for exploring the affordances of web-based composition. You‚Äôll find:

* **[Projects](projects/)** ‚Äì Research and creative work highlighting digital rhetoric, interface design, and online authorship.
* **[Teaching](teaching/)** ‚Äì Sample syllabi, assignments, and reflections on pedagogy in digital contexts.
* **Blog or Updates** *(optional)* ‚Äì Informal reflections, class updates, and posts about digital culture.

All content is built using **Markdown**, **GitHub Pages**, and **Jekyll**, demonstrating how web literacies intersect with scholarly communication.

### Current Work

I‚Äôm currently developing a project that examines how working-class writers use digital platforms to share knowledge, build community, and challenge traditional literacy hierarchies. This research bridges **digital humanities**, **rhetoric and composition**, and **cultural studies**.
